# Gun detection Project

Detects guns in images and videos using computer vision and Object Detection.
It is built with Python and leverages deep learning models for accurate detection


## Features
- Detects guns in real-time from video streams or images  
- Provides bounding boxes around detected objects  
- Supports model training and testing pipelines  
- Uses DVC for tracking large models and datasets 

## Model
The pre-trained Faster R-CNN model for gun detection can be downloaded here:
